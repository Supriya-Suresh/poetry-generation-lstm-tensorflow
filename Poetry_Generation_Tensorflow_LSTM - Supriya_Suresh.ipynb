round\\r\\nThinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]\\r\\nI gave you heaven on a platter baby\\r\\nI gave you everything you never gave me\\r\\nI never lied and I never faked it\\r\\nOnly wanted for you to save me\\r\\nThis love, it ain\\'t over yet\\r\\nThere\\'s too much that I haven\\'t said [Chorus]\\r\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\r\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\r\\nIt was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\r\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Verse 2]\\r\\nWhy were you so cold, let the truth be told\\r\\nTell me was it all for the thrill?\\r\\nWhat was I thinking, I gave you everything\\r\\nBut you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]\\r\\nI gave you heaven on a platter baby\\r\\nI gave you everything you never gave me\\r\\nI never lied and I never faked it\\r\\nOnly wanted for you to save me [Chorus]\\r\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\r\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\r\\nIt was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\r\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Bridge]\\r\\nOooh sometimes I feel like I\\'m in the dark\\r\\nOooh I thought I\\'d die in your arms [Chorus]\\r\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\r\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\r\\nIt was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat\\r\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Outro]\\r\\nHope you know, I won\\'t let go I thought I told you, he\\'d be home soon\\r\\nCouldn\\'t help myself, you\\'re too good to be true.\\r\\nI fall short each time,\\r\\nEvery time he ain\\'t here\\r\\nYou and your charm creep closer\\r\\nCloser and near\\r\\nLike a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.\\r\\nLike a bomb before explosion,\\r\\nTicking by your call,\\r\\nYou\\'re the wiser one, disguised from greed,\\r\\nAnd I\\'m just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,\\r\\nThan I ever did you before,\\r\\nSo stand beside the river I cried,\\r\\nAnd lay yourself down.\\r\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you. So, you thought that I\\'d crumble to my knees\\r\\nAt the first sight of you crawling back to me\\r\\nTo whisper \"will you leave your man? \"\\r\\nCause you swear that this time you can stand by me.\\r\\nI won\\'t stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,\\r\\nThan I ever did you before,\\r\\nSo stand beside the river I cried\\r\\nAnd lay yourself down.\\r\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! I ain\\'t yours for no taking,\\r\\nYou must be mistaken\\r\\nI could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong\\r\\nAnd ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,\\r\\nThan you ever did me before.\\r\\nSo stand beside the river you cried\\r\\nAnd lay yourself down!\\r\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! Found myself today singing out your name,\\r\\nYou said I\\'m crazy,\\r\\nIf I am I\\'m crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here\\r\\nTurns me crazy,\\r\\nBut it\\'s you who makes me lose my head. And every time I\\'m meant to be acting sensible\\r\\nYou drift into my head\\r\\nAnd turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I\\'ll race,\\r\\nIf you want me to stop I\\'ll freeze,\\r\\nAnd if you want me gone. I\\'ll leave, just hold me closer baby,\\r\\nAnd make me crazy for you.\\r\\nCrazy for you. Lately with this state I\\'m in I can\\'t help myself but spin.\\r\\nI wish you\\'d come over,\\r\\nSend me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it\\'s sweet taste for you,\\r\\nStrips me down bare\\r\\nAnd gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,\\r\\nBut the more I do,\\r\\nThe crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,\\r\\nHoping you\\'ll walk through\\r\\nAnd save me boy,\\r\\nBecause I\\'m too crazy for you.\\r\\nCrazy for you Everybody tells me it\\'s \\'bout time that I moved on\\r\\nAnd I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young\\r\\nBut my heart is a valley, it\\'s so shallow and man made\\r\\nI\\'m scared to death if I let you in that you\\'ll see I\\'m just a fake\\r\\nSometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch\\r\\nBut I know that\\'s just me, \\'cause nothing ever is enough\\r\\nWhen I was a child I grew up by the River Lea\\r\\nThere was something in the water, now that something\\'s in me\\r\\nOh I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\r\\nI can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my

chance\\r\\nNo, I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\r\\nI can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\r\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain

I\\'ve had enough of love So little to say but so much time\\r\\nDespite my empty mouth the words are in my mind\\r\\nPlease wear the face, the one where you smile\\r\\nBecause you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I\\'m tired\\r\\nI need to get away to feel again\\r\\nTry to understand why, don\\'t get so close to change my mind\\r\\nPlease wipe that look out of your eyes, it\\'s bribing me to doubt myself\\r\\nSimply, it\\'s tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind\\r\\nAnd if I stay I\\'ll be alive\\r\\nThen choke on words I\\'d always hide\\r\\nExcuse me first love, but we\\'re through\\r\\nI need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I\\'m too tired\\r\\nI\\'m bored to say the least and I, I lack desire\\r\\nForgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love\\r\\nForgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end\\r\\nHold your breath and count to ten\\r\\nFeel the earth move and then\\r\\nHear my heart burst again For this is the end\\r\\nI\\'ve drowned and dreamt this moment\\r\\nSo overdue I owe them\\r\\nSwept away, I\\'m stolen Let the skyfall\\r\\nWhen it crumbles\\r\\nWe will stand tall\\r\\nFace it all together Let the skyfall\\r\\nWhen it crumbles\\r\\nWe will stand tall\\r\\nFace it all together\\r\\nAt

how the story went\\r\\nI met someone by accident\\r\\nIt blew me away\\r\\nBlew me away It was in the darkest of my days\\r\\nWhen you took my sorrow and you took my pain\\r\\nAnd buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you\\r\\nWhen the day is done\\r\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\r\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\r\\nYou disappear one day\\r\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station\\r\\nPut a kiss on top of your head\\r\\nWatch you wave\\r\\nAnd watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers\\r\\nAnd neon lights and waiting papers\\r\\nThat I call home\\r\\nI call that home I wish I could lay down beside you\\r\\nWhen the day is done\\r\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\r\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\r\\nYou disappear one day\\r\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted\\r\\nI\\'m going back to where I started\\r\\nThe morning rain, the morning rain\\r\\nAnd though I wish that you were here\\r\\nOn that same old road that brought me here\\r\\nIt\\'s calling me home, It\\'s calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you\\r\\nWhen the day is done\\r\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\r\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\r\\nYou disappear one day\\r\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away\\r\\nI can\\'t spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there\\'s air made of bricks\\r\\nPulls me down turns me weak for you\\r\\nI find myself repeating like a broken tune\\r\\nAnd I\\'m forever excusing your intentions\\r\\nThat I give in to my pretendings\\r\\nWhich forgive you each time\\r\\nWithout me knowing\\r\\nThey melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\r\\nYou say my name like there could be an us\\r\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\r\\nI\\'m the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave\\r\\nI feel my heart begin to burst and bleed\\r\\nSo desperately I try to link it with my head\\r\\nBut instead I fall back to my knees\\r\\nAs you tear your way right through me\\r\\nI forgive you once again\\r\\nWithout me knowing\\r\\nYou\\'ve burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\r\\nYou say my name like there could be an us\\r\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\r\\nI\\'m the only one in love Why do you steal my hand\\r\\nWhenever I\\'m standing my own ground\\r\\nYou build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up\\r\\nI say your name like there should be an us\\r\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one, in love\\r\\nI\\'m the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you\\r\\nAnd fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette\\r\\nAnd my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you\\'d understand\\r\\nAnd thinking you would listen to all of the things\\r\\nThe things I had planned But we couldn\\'t see eye to eye\\r\\nSo darling\\r\\nDarling\\r\\nDarling this is goodbye Oh\\r\\nI still care\\r\\nFool that I am\\r\\nOoh\\r\\nI still care\\r\\nFool that I am You say it\\'s all in my head\\r\\nAnd the things I think just don\\'t make sense\\r\\nSo where you been then? Don\\'t go all coy\\r\\nDon\\'t turn it round on me like it\\'s my fault\\r\\nSee I can see that look in your eyes\\r\\nThe one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\r\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you\\r\\nYou make it look like I\\'m see-through\\r\\nDo tell me why you waste our time\\r\\nWhen your heart ain\\'t in it, and you\\'re not satisfied\\r\\nYou know I know just how you feel\\r\\nI\\'m starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\r\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool\\r\\n(Just for you)\\r\\nEven in the daylight when you think that\\r\\n(I don\\'t see you)\\r\\nTry to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\\r\\nThough I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\r\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\r\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\r\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]\\r\\nWhy do you love me\\r\\nDo you love me...?\\r\\nWhy do you love me\\r\\nDo you love me?\\r\\nWhy do you love me\\r\\nDo you love me?
